        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>I'm working towards having my own shop. I have worked with people from dealerships and i have learn many tips that would be able to help me on the long run.
I work at mechanic shop on my side, to have more experience working cars  and being more hands on. I have learn other things beside fixing cars like tinting widows and changing interiors.
Being able to be more hands on and learning new things about cars and researching more about how every parts and what I need to make the car run. Having the cars to be able to work on.
I hope to be able to work full-time and having the possibility to work the cars on my own without anyone else's help. 
One other goal is to finish working on my car and having it push high horse powe A Trait people talk about is that I'm a very hard worker and I don't tent to give up when things start to get hard. 
I find it easy to work with other when we have things in common such as cars or others things. 
I mostly like to work alone to see how far I can push myself though.</P>
